{"tossups": [{"question": "An essay by Anna Lardo in The Ludic Self in Seventeenth-Century English Literature uses this concept to analyze the play Hamlet. In the book Violent Origins, this concept is illustrated by a subject hearing a model say \"imitate me,\" leading to a contest in which the subject and model form a rivalry over the same object.
